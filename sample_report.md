## **Equity Research Report: Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (O39.SI)**

**June 28, 2025**

### **1. Fundamental Analysis**

- **Revenue Growth & Margin Trends:** OCBC's Q1 2025 results highlight a resilient, though mixed, operating environment. Net profit was S$1.88 billion, down 5% year-over-year (YoY) but up 12% from the prior quarter, beating analyst estimates. The YoY decline was primarily driven by a 4% drop in Net Interest Income (NII) to S$2.35 billion. This reflects significant Net Interest Margin (NIM) compression, which fell 23 basis points YoY to 2.04% as loan yields adjusted to the lower interest rate outlook more quickly than deposit costs.
- **Fee Income & Non-Interest Income:** The standout strength was non-interest income, which surged 10% YoY to S$1.31 billion. This was driven by a 14% YoY increase in net fee income to S$546 million, propelled by strong wealth management, brokerage, and investment banking activity. The bank's wealth management income, a key strategic focus, rose an impressive 29% from the previous quarter to S$1.37 billion, now contributing 38% of the Group's total income. This robust fee growth provides a critical offset to the pressures on interest income.
- **Free Cash Flow & Capital Position:** As a bank, traditional free cash flow is less relevant than capital adequacy. OCBC maintains a very strong capital position with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio that is comfortably above regulatory minimums. This financial strength allows the bank to support business growth, weather economic uncertainties, and sustain its capital return program to shareholders.
- **Valuation vs. Sector Peers:** OCBC currently offers the most attractive valuation among its Singaporean peers, trading at a discount on both P/E and P/B ratios while providing a superior dividend yield.

| Metric (as of May/June 2025) | OCBC Bank (O39) | DBS Group (D05) | UOB (U11) |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------- |
| P/E Ratio                    | ~9.7x           | ~11.4x          | ~9.8x     |
| P/B Ratio                    | ~1.2x           | ~1.8x           | ~1.2x     |
| Dividend Yield (FY24 basis)  | ~6.2%           | ~5.1%           | ~5.9%     |

- **Insider Ownership & Recent Insider Trades:** Retail investors hold a majority stake (54%) in OCBC, which is unique for a major bank and ensures that management incentives are well-aligned with shareholder returns, particularly regarding dividends. Insider ownership is low (under 1%), and recent activity does not indicate any significant concerns.

### **2. Thesis Validation**

- **Arguments Supporting Thesis (Bullish):**
  1.  **Compelling Valuation & Superior Yield:** OCBC is demonstrably the "cheapest" of the three Singapore banks, trading at a lower P/E and P/B ratio while offering the highest dividend yield. This presents a clear value proposition for investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.
  2.  **Wealth Management Growth Engine:** The bank's strategic focus on capturing rising Asian wealth is bearing fruit. The significant growth in wealth-related fee income provides a high-quality, less cyclical earnings stream that mitigates the impact of interest rate fluctuations and supports a premium valuation over time.
  3.  **Strong Capital Returns:** With a strong balance sheet, OCBC is actively returning capital to shareholders. The recent announcement of a S$2.5 billion share buyback program, alongside its generous dividend policy, underscores a commitment to enhancing shareholder value.

- **Counter-Arguments & Key Risks:**
  1.  **NIM Sensitivity:** OCBC's NIM has shown more sensitivity to falling interest rates compared to its peers. While management has maintained its 2025 guidance for NIMs around 2%, a more aggressive cycle of rate cuts than the currently anticipated three could lead to further margin compression and pressure on net interest income.
  2.  **ASEAN & China Exposure:** While a source of long-term growth, the bank's significant presence in the ASEAN region and Greater China exposes it to regional geopolitical risks and potential economic slowdowns, which could impact loan growth and asset quality.

- **Final Verdict: Bullish**
  - **Justification:** The combination of a discounted valuation, a sector-leading dividend yield, and a clear growth strategy centered on the burgeoning Asian wealth management sector creates a highly attractive risk/reward profile. OCBC's ability to offset interest rate headwinds with strong fee income growth demonstrates the resilience of its business model.

### **3. Sector & Macro View**

- **Sector Overview:** The Singapore banking sector is fundamentally strong, with robust capital buffers and a favorable regulatory environment. While the era of rapid NIM expansion from rising rates is over, banks are successfully pivoting to non-interest income growth. The sector remains a prime beneficiary of Singapore's status as a global wealth management hub, attracting significant capital inflows.
- **Macroeconomic Trends:** Singapore's GDP growth is projected to slow in 2025 to between 0-2%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has begun to ease its policy stance, which will continue to put downward pressure on interest rates. However, this is partially offset by resilient loan demand and the structural tailwind of wealth accumulation in the region.
- **Company’s Competitive Positioning:** OCBC is a premier financial institution in Asia. Its "One Group" strategy aims to create an integrated customer experience, leveraging its strong brand, banking franchise, and its ownership of Great Eastern Holdings (insurance) and Bank of Singapore (private banking). The recent integration of its securities business into the Global Markets division is a strategic move to enhance its wealth management offerings for high-net-worth clients and capture more value from regional capital market flows.

### **4. Catalyst Watch**

- **Short-Term (0-6 months):**
  - **Q2 2025 Earnings Release:** Focus will be on the stabilization of NIM, continued momentum in fee income, and progress on the share buyback program.
  - **Dividend Announcement:** The interim dividend declaration will be a key data point for income-focused investors.
  - **Great Eastern Delisting:** Further developments on the bid to delist Great Eastern could unlock value and streamline the group structure.
- **Long-Term (6-24 months):**
  - **ASEAN-Greater China Strategy:** Successful execution of its strategy to capture increasing trade and investment flows between these two economic blocs will be a key long-term growth driver.
  - **Interest Rate Cycle:** A stabilization or eventual turn in the interest rate cycle would provide a significant tailwind to net interest margins.
  - **Digital Innovation:** Continued investment in digital platforms to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency.

### **5. Investment Summary**

- **5-Bullet Investment Thesis Summary:**
  - **Value Play:** Trades at a compelling discount to peers on P/E and P/B ratios.
  - **Top-Tier Yield:** Offers the most attractive and sustainable dividend yield in the Singapore banking sector.
  - **Wealth Management Power:** A key beneficiary of secular growth in Asian wealth, driving high-margin fee income.
  - **Shareholder-Friendly:** Actively returning capital through both dividends and a significant share buyback program.
  - **Resilient Business Model:** Diversified income streams provide a buffer against macroeconomic and interest rate cycle volatility.
- **Valuation & Price Targets:**
  - **Good Value Buy Range:** **S$15.50 - S$16.50** (This range offers a P/B ratio around its historical average and a compelling dividend yield).
  - **Target Price Sell Range:** **S$18.50 - S$19.50** (This target implies a re-rating closer to its peer average P/B and reflects the successful execution of its wealth strategy).
- **Final Recommendation:** **Buy**
- **Confidence Level:** **High**
- **Expected Timeframe:** **12–24 months**
